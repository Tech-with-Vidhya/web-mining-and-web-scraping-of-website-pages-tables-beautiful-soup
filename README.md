# web-mining-and-web-scraping-of-website-pages-tables-beautiful-soup

This project covers the Implementation of the Web Mining and Web Scraping of the 2 public website pages with html tables and 2 QMUL’s internal website pages with html table using Python’s “Beautiful Soup” module for web scraping, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib libraries.   

The solution includes scraping the specific contents from the web page html tables as per the custom filter requisites, converted the scraped table contents into a readable pandas dataframe table with customised columns, performed data cleaning steps to remove any unnecessary characters from the pandas table and exported the clean table data into a csv file for all the 4 web pages individually.  

**NOTE:** Due to the data privacy and the data protection policy to be adhered by the students; the datasets and the solution related code are not exposed and updated in the GitHub public profile; in order to be compliant with the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) policies.
